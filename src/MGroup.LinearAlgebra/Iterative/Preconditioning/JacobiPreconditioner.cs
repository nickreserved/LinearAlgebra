//TODO: Use a dedicated DiagonalMatrix class, instead of passing in double[] or Vector. It will implement the inverse and 
//      multiplication routines. It will also handle distributed matrices. E.g. IDiagonal IMatrixView.GetDiagonal() which will 
//      then have an IDiagonalMatrix.Inverse(). The problem is how we will go from CSR to DiagonalMatrix. Perhaps it would be 
//      better to use the DOK instead.
//TODO: Alternative: instead of demanding the caller to extract the diagonal, this class should read the matrix and only access 
//      its diagonal. I think this alternative is less flexible and more difficult to implement.
